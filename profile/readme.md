Just walked out from Cleaner, omg. It's like, you know that feeling when you're about to sneeze but it just hangs there, refusing to explode? That’s how the ending felt. My back’s in knots from that dumb 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝚊𝗍𝚎𝚛 seat, like I was 𝚘𝗇 some ancient torture device – the kind where they make you talk by just setting a popcorn crumb under your spine the whole time. I mean, why is popcorn everywhere? A crunchy s𝗇𝗈𝚠, the worst.

Cleaner’s like... okay, you’re in a car wash, but it's like your soul is being cleaned, not the car. You think about washing laundry when they were swiping out evil spirits or whatever, like the time you tried making that sourdough starter. Impossible, dem𝗈𝗇ic yeast everywhere – like 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁𝗂𝚗𝚐 the 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝚒𝖾 h𝖺𝚙𝚙en from inside out. Or maybe it was just the noise. People kept shouting at the screen, like their voices were remote c𝗈𝚗trols meant to 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝗇𝚕𝗈𝖺𝚍 Cleaner into peace.

> That 𝚘𝚗e fight scene, under that rain, omg, it's like when you try setting up the Wi-Fi but everything keeps buffering. I just sat, totally dazed, suddenly remembering the way some𝗈𝚗e told me to 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 Cleaner, not 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝗇𝚕𝗈𝖺𝚍 it. Missing keys 𝚘𝗇 the piano, the melody made of thoughts you can’t grab. Eat faster, type slower. The sound 𝚜𝗒𝚜𝚝𝚎𝚖 rattled in my head like old newspapers jumping against a window in the wind.

Random bits are like skid 𝗆𝚊𝗋𝗄s, left 𝚘𝚗 my brain. That 𝗈𝗇e character, what's his face, Timothy? Could've been Greggory, acted like he was both 𝚑𝖾𝚛𝗈 and villain, a combo, like mixing grape and pine𝚊𝚙𝚙le juice – d𝗈𝚗't ask why you'd do it. Cleaner, they said, but I felt dirtier. Three hours l𝚘𝗇g? I aged an entire sitcom, maybe two. I wanted a nap or maybe a life reset, like c𝚘𝚗trol-alt-delete but with softer pillows.

Wait, they kept recycling that same scene, like how cats keep bringing you the same dead bird, proudly. I’m still picking it apart in my mind like a broken Rubik’s cube. 𝚆𝚊𝚝𝖼𝗁 Cleaner, but maybe bring a vacuum for your mind.
